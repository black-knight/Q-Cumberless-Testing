Q-Cumberless Testing
====================

Q-Cumberless Testing is a graphical user interface for writing and executing [Cucumber](http://cukes.info) tests. It is easily extendable as it allows third-parties to write their own plugins and can thus be used in any test setup based on Cucumber.

Up and Running
==============

Fetch a [release](https://github.com/black-knight/Q-Cumberless-Testing/tree/master/release/release_0.2.8) or a [nightly build](https://github.com/black-knight/Q-Cumberless-Testing/tree/master/release/nightly) from github and run the jar-file. This should run Q-Cumberless Testing with the generic device plugin.

Look at the wiki for more information, including a custom plugin integrating with [calabash-android](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android).

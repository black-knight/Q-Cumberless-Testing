Q-Cumberless Testing
--------------------

Q-Cumberless Testing is a graphical user interface for writing and executing Cucumber tests. It is easily extendable as it allows third-parties to write their own plugins and can thus be used in any test setup based on Cucumber.

Up and Running
--------------

Fetch a release or a nightly build from github and run the jar-file. This should run Q-Cumberless Testing with the generic device plugin.

Look at the wiki for more information, including a custom plugin integrating with calabash-android.
